### Problems:

1. The objective of the first part of the problem statement is to predict the Covid Cases of a
   City on 1st September 2020. 
   The Output file 01 should contain only City and the respective Covid Cases for the test data.

2. The Foreign Visitors of a city is a time-dependent parameter, for which you have to come up
   with a Time-series prediction model. Using the Foreign Visitors predicted by the model, you
   need to calculate the Covid Cases on 1st Oct 2020 for every City in the test data.
   The Output file 02 should contain only City and the respective Covid Cases on 1st October.

### File Description:

1.  Variable-Description.xlsx:
    This file contains description of all the variables available in the dataset

2.  Train-dataset.xlsx:
    This is the training dataset on which model has to be trained, which contains parameters of a
    city on 1st September 2020

3.  Test-dataset.xlsx (Test_data,Foreign_Visitors_TS):
    This is the test data on which accuracy of the model will be computed. 
    It also contains Time Series data of Foreign Visitors to be used for Problem â€“ 2.
